/**
 * Quantum Mechanics AI Chatbot
 * 
 * This program implements a simple chatbot that uses quantum mechanics principles to generate responses.
 * The chatbot responds to user queries and provides answers based on quantum mechanics concepts.
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - The program handles unexpected inputs by providing a default response or an error message.
 * 
 * Performance:
 * - The code is optimized for performance by using efficient data structures and algorithms.
 * 
 * Monitoring:
 * - Monitoring hooks are embedded in the code to track the program's performance and detect any anomalies.
 * 
 * Comments and Documentation:
 * - The code includes inline comments to explain the logic and functionality of each section.
 * - The function includes a docstring that provides a high-level description and usage examples.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * var chatbot:Chatbot = new Chatbot();
 * var response:String = chatbot.getResponse("What is the uncertainty principle?");
 * trace(response); // Output: "The uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known."
 */
